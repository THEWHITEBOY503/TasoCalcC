# TasoCalcC
Calculator for Kelwing's Taso discord bot


I advise using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 because that's what I wrote this in. 
Set up is simple. Copy/paste the code or import the .cs file into your favorite IDE and compile! 
Made in .NET Framework

**Note: TasoCalcC will not work if your Taso level has passed 30. This is because after level 30, the amount of XP per message is randomized.**
